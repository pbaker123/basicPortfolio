							I am happily married since September 1, 2013.  We do not have any children, but we would like to have one or two children in the next five years.  My sister-in-law moved to Austin in April of 2017, and she is also looking to have children in the next few years.  My wife and I decided it would be great when we have children for them to know their cousins.  So, we relocated from Suwanee, Georgia to Austin Texas in August of 2017.

							I have played soccer since I was 8 years old.  I’ve had to slow down in the last few years due to injuries.  In the spare time, I have picked up pilates, yoga, hiking, and sailing.  My brother-in-law and I recently purchased a 1984 S2 s69 sailboat.  We are currently retrofitting her for a more modern look.

							I began my career as a manager at a quick serve restaurant chain called Zaxby’s.  This allowed me to pay my way through college, and I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Managerial Sciences.  At that time, the job market was fairly soft, so I was fortunate to have a friend that needed an additional temporary worker at Toshiba.  As soon as a posting for another job became available I applied and moved into a permanent role.  I’ve now been with Toshiba for nine years, but the company has morphed and merged several times.  Currently, I am working on education for the self-checkout line of products.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am currently enrolled in a full-stack web-development boot camp.  When I graduate, I wish to start a new career in this field.
